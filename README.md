## Introduction

This repository was created as part of my journey to learn statistical computing with R. It includes various examples, exercises, and projects that demonstrate my learning process. The focus is on understanding fundamental statistical concepts and applying them using R.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have R installed on your system. You can download and install R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

In general, packages can be found on either [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Crantastic](http://crantastic.org/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/trending/r/)

Additionally, you will need to install the following R packages:

```r

# I recommend "pacman" for managing add-on packages. It will
# install packages, if needed, and then load the packages.
install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(pacman, dplyr, GGally, ggplot2, ggthemes, 
  ggvis, httr, lubridate, plotly, rio, rmarkdown, shiny, 
  stringr, tidyr) 

library(datasets)  # Load/unload base packages manually

```
