# Visualization Guide

## Plot
Adapts to data types and the number of variables, which means it works everywhere.

## Bar Chart
The most basic graphic for the most basic data.

## Histogram
For data that is quantitative, scaled, measured, interval, or ratio level.

### Helps With:
- Seeing the shape of the distribution (symmetrical, skewed, unimodal, bimodal, etc.)
- Identifying gaps in the distribution
- Detecting outliers
- Assessing symmetry

## Scatter Plot
Visualizes the association between two quantitative variables.

### Helps With:
- Determining if there is a linear association between the two variables, as most procedures assume linearity
- Checking for consistent spread across scores from one end of the x-axis to the other
- Identifying outliers
- Analyzing correlation (is there an association between these two variables)
